Note: Per the FAA, Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA) (PDF) grants the Secretary of Transportation the authority to determine whether an airworthiness certificate
is required for a UAS to operate safely in the National Airspace System (NAS). This authority is being leveraged to grant case-by-case authorization for certain unmanned aircraft to perform
commercial operations prior to the finalization of the Small UAS Rule, which will be the primary method for authorizing small UAS operations once it is complete.

Cyber Attacks = Growing Bigger / Faster...
• Insider Misuse = Significant Cause of Breaches
&gt;20% of breaches come directly from insiders with malicious intent. In most
breaches, attackers have foothold within internal networks &amp; spread / steal data
through privilege abuse / credential misuse.
• Mobile Devices = Increasingly Used to Harvest Data
Adware grew 136% to 410,000 apps between 2013 and first three quarters of
2014, giving attackers access to personal information such as contacts, which
can subsequently be used to launch phishing attacks.
• Mobile Device Management = Critical in Preventing Breaches
22% of breaches reported by network security decision makers involve lost /
stolen devices.

...Cyber Attacks = Growing Bigger / Faster
• Human Focus = Critical in Preventing / Remediating Attacks
Despite abundance of security products, breach response typically takes months.
~4 of 5 organizations don’t update their breach response plans to account for
changing threat landscape and corporate processes. With proper technology, threat
intelligence &amp; expertise, detection to response times has been reduced by &gt;90%.
• Security Skills = Biggest Gap in Enterprise Security Programs
Despite large investments in security technologies, lack of skilled experts continues
to result in breaches. At least 30% of organizations cite a ‘problematic shortage’ of
each of following: 1) cloud computing and server virtualization security skills; 2)
endpoint security skills; 3) network security skills; 4) data security skills; 5) security
analytics / forensic skills.
• Disclosures of Breaches = Coming from Outside Sources
In 69% of breaches, victim did not detect attack on own – they were notified by third
party (like the press, law enforcement, etc.). This is forcing victims to disclose
breaches outside their preferred terms / timing.

Uber, Lyft... = Facing Confusion in Regulatory Environment
Related to Worker Classification System
Source: Cotter vs. Lyft Inc., et al Order Denying Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, 3/15.
National Law Review, 3/15
California law defines whether workers are employees or independent
contractors, and there’s a test, but the test and classification system
are woefully outdated...
...It seems to me, as a matter of common sense, that Lyft drivers don’t
fall into the traditional understanding of [the two
classifications]. They seem to fall into a third category....
The jury in this case will be handed a square peg and asked to choose
between two round holes. The test the California courts have
developed over the 20th Century for classifying workers isn't very
helpful in addressing this 21st Century problem...
- Judge Vince Chhabria, U.S. District Judge Presiding Over Cotter vs. Lyft Inc., et al
*Note that Lyft was eventually denied motion for summary judgement &amp; case will need to be decided by a jury.

Airbnb = Facing Confusion in Regulatory Environment
Related to Myriad of Local Laws on Hotels / Short-Term Rentals
Source: “The Future of Airbnb in Cities,” McKinsey &amp; Company Interview with Brian Chesky (Cofounder and CEO of Airbnb), 11/14.
...this is amazing, but it’s also complicated because there are laws that
were written many decades ago – sometimes a century ago – that said,
‘There are laws for people and there are laws for business.’ What happens
when a person becomes a business?
Suddenly these laws feel a little bit outdated. They’re really 20th-century
laws, and we’re in a 21st-century economy.

StubHub = Faced Confusion in Regulatory Environment &amp;
Proved Marketplaces Can Be Regulators’ Allies
Source: “Lessons from a Scalper” by David Harrington, Kenyon College, Spring 2009.
“A Brief Overview on Ticket Scalping Laws, Secondary Ticket Markets, and the StubHub Effect,” Entertainment and Sports Lawyer, 11/12.
Original Intent of Anti-Scalping Laws (passed in 1920s) = Protect Consumers...
...the law ‘merely prohibits’ scalpers and ticket brokers from charging excessive prices and
thereby ‘end[s] the extortion’ of the public...
StubHub When Founded in 2000 = Faced Many Anti-Scalping Law Barriers...
&gt;20 states prohibited some form of ticket resale...for example, Alabama / Massachusetts
require licenses...in Indiana, one couldn’t sell tickets to boxing matches...
StubHub in 2015 = Legal in Nearly All States &amp; Has Helped Provide...
• Marketplace Liquidity = Can help prevent excessive pricing (‘extortion of public’)
• Trust &amp; Safety / Transparency = Likes of ratings / feedback systems can help find /
remove bad actors
With passage of time (&amp; collaboration), StubHub has helped regulators do
their jobs – effectively regulate what they had intended to regulate all along.

Technology-Related Company Investing Observations
• Booms / Busts – In periods of material business disruption – like
those brought about by the evolutions of the Internet – company
creation typically goes through a boom  bust  boom-let cycle
while wealth creation typically goes through a boom-let  bust 
boom cycle.
• Valuations – There are pockets of Internet company overvaluation
but there are also pockets of undervaluation – the one rule is that
very few companies will win – those that do – can win big.
• Platforms – Race is won by those that build platforms &amp; drive free
cash flow over long-term (a decade or more).
• Free Cash Flow – Value of a business, over time, is the present
value of its future cash flows.

Diversity Matters...It’s Just Good Business
One of the things I have learned about
effective decision making is that the best
decisions are often made by diverse
groups of people.
Saying or hearing these words is magic...
‘That’s really interesting, I had never
thought of it that way before. Thank you.’

complexity
Key Design Concepts That Have Made a Difference...
per John Maeda...
Google Search
Hide complexity behind
a simple door
Instagram
Remove choice to make
things simpler
Tinder
Iconic gesture for choosing
“thumbs up/down”
The longstanding discipline by Google to keep
the homepage limited to a single search box has
been key to maintaining its simplicity. Once a
search term is typed into Google, it gets complex
really quickly -- but you don’t notice it at first.
Analogy: The Motorola Startac phone introduced
a clamshell design that hid all the complexity --
to be revealed only when used.
By removing the need to choose portrait versus
landscape mode, Instagram made it easier for
the user. Only square photos could be taken on
Instagram -- which were uncommon at the time
and could stand out. Instagram made things
easy.
Analogy: Similar to when Steve Jobs removed
the extra buttons on a mouse to have only one
button. In doing so, the Mac became known for
simplicity.
Traditional computers are grounded in the one-
or two-button mouse -- which tends to promote
“clicking” and minimal dragging. The touch
screen introduced a new element: swiping.
When supported by animation, it speaks of
power.
Analogy: The “slide to unlock” feature on the
Apple iPhone introduced the idea of translating
an emphatic motion to a button press.

...Design Elements That Have Made a Difference...
per John Maeda
Snapchat
Start with the activity to
bias towards
Uber
Entirely remove a constraint
with technology
Typeform
Sustain overall context so user is
aware where (s)he is
Most imaging applications asked to turn on the
camera, whereas Snapchat began the interaction
in live camera mode. The invitation to snap a
photo was immediate; and the secretive, self-
destruct feature completed the addictive loop.
Analogy: A hammer’s handle invites you to grasp
it. In the design world that’s called an object’s
“affordance” — it primes how you might use it.
By keeping the entire interaction in view, and
easily referred to within a vertical scroll, the
experience of inputting information feels less like
the computer is in control; and leads to
completion rates of survey information with an
average of 60% (vs 10%).
Analogy: The acclaimed film “Birdman” used the
cinematic illusion of “the single take” to achieve a
similar effect to create greater viewer immersion.
Removing cash or a card payment from a taxi
transaction was a huge technical innovation that
achieved a better designed outcome. It’s often easy to
hope that design can solve a fundamental problem —
technology is what enables quantum leaps.
Analogy: When cars were rear-wheel drive, the
“hump” in the back seat was a bummer. Front-wheel
drive cars completely removed that constraint.

Lower Healthcare Costs by Utilizing Technology to Help
Manage and Prevent Chronic Diseases
• In 2013, the US government spent $591 billion on Medicare. However, Medicare is
projected to have insufficient funds to pay all hospital bills beginning in 2030
• Chronic disease accounts for 86% of US healthcare costs, which can be reduced by
enabling the healthcare ecosystem with innovative technology

Consumer / Commercial Drone Development –
Ranking Countries by Government Accommodation...
Source: News articles, KPCB analysis – Wen Hsieh / James Tang / Paul Yeh.
1) France &amp; United Kingdom
• Both countries allow Beyond Visual Line of Sight “BVLOS” commercial operations.
• In France, users must obtain a proper pilot’s license plus 100 hours of flying experience &amp;
20 hours of drone training.
• In United Kingdom, operator must be approved by the Civil Aviation Authority “CAA.”
• France &amp; UK both have training certifications, weight categories &amp; relatively mature regulatory
framework.
2) Canada
• Early to allow commercial operations with Special Flight Operating Certificates and regulator
takes holistic safety approach without requiring pilots licenses. In November 2014, Transport
Canada issued blanket exemptions for drones weighing less than 2kgs, but restrictions are tight
whereby UAVs 2kg or less have to avoid flying closer than 9km from build-up areas (e.g. group
of buildings larger than a farmstead).
• Still lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework.
3) Australia
• Australia has a mature regulatory framework, but Civil Aviation and Safety Authority “CASA” is
rewriting its regulations with the concept of a micro UAS rule. Yamaha has had success in
Australia with its R-MAX unmanned helicopter.
4) Japan
• Led way on UAVs 20 years ago with development of the Yamaha R-MAX, but country did not
develop regulatory structure, and has lost its early technical lead.

...Consumer / Commercial Drone Development –
Ranking Countries by Government Accommodation
5) USA
• FAA is about 6 months into an exemption program that grants company-by-company exemptions
(permits) for specific UAS applications. However, those permits come with restrictions &amp; conditions that
pose impediments to operators, such as pilot certification (in a real aircraft), mandatory separation from
persons and structures (500 feet), a prohibition against night operations, &amp; other parameters that are
generally viewed as overly conservative &amp; potentially not capable of being satisfied by many of the
companies being granted those permits. Agency claims that statutes prohibit it from providing a more
reasonable approach to UAS permits.
• FAA is trying to speed up its processes, and is now up to ~400 exemptions granted to companies.
However, it still has a massive backlog with ~1,200 more pending. Additionally, the FAA is at least 18
months away from actual small UAS rules.
6) China
• Military allots only 1/5 of airspace to civilian use and is very sensitive about drone usage. While there is
no blanket ban on commercial drone activity, China’s Civil Aviation Administration requires anyone
operating a drone &gt;7kg to have a license. For flying drones &lt;7kg, no license is required as long as it’s
below 400 feet and within operator’s line of sight. However, this policy has caused confusion among
operators and regulators. In one example, the Beijing Police briefly detained a well-known aerial
photographer for filming the Forbidden City - they confiscated his quadcopter and later returned it to the
photographer at the airport on his flight out of China.
• Other countries developing UAS regulations
• Mexico recently released framework including micro UAS rule.
• New Zealand is behind but has proposed a solid risk-based set of regulations.
